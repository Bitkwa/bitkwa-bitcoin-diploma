# BitKwa Bitcoin Diploma Community Guidelines

Welcome to the BitKwa Bitcoin Diploma community! This space exists to **learn, share, and grow together around Bitcoin knowledge and adoption** in Africa. To ensure everyone has a safe, productive, and supportive environment, we ask all participants to follow these guidelines.

---

## 1. Be Respectful and Inclusive
- Treat all participants with **respect**, regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, location, or background.  
- Listen actively and **value diverse perspectives**. Bitcoin and technology thrive in diverse communities.  
- Avoid discriminatory, offensive, or harassing language.  
- Engage in constructive discussions; disagreements should be about ideas, not people.

---

## 2. Focus on Bitcoin Education and Projects
- Keep discussions and shared content **relevant to Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, financial inclusion, and program projects**.  
- Avoid off-topic conversations unrelated to the BitKwa program.  
- Share **resources, tutorials, and learning experiences** to support community growth.  
- Encourage others to experiment, ask questions, and apply knowledge in real-world projects.

---

## 3. Privacy and Security
- Do **not share personal contact information** of other members without consent.  
- Avoid sharing sensitive financial information. Bitcoin education discussions should be **informational only**, not financial advice.  
- Use pseudonyms or limited personal details if preferred.  
- Respect the privacy of cohort participants and mentors.

## 4. Collaboration and Mentorship
- Collaborate respectfully on projects, assignments, or initiatives.  
- Mentors and alumni should guide without dominating; encourage peer learning.

- Share constructive feedback that helps peers improve their skills and knowledge.

- Join and participate in **webinars, discussion sessions, and forums** regularly.  
- Ask thoughtful questions, answer where you can, and **help peers solve problems**.  
- Celebrate community achievements and milestones.  
- Report issues or conflicts to community moderators rather than handling them privately.

## 6. Code of Conduct for Online Platforms
- Follow the rules of the platforms hosting the community (e.g., Discord, Telegram, GitHub).  
- Avoid spamming channels with repeated posts or unrelated links.  
- Use threads or channels properly to keep discussions organized.  
- Moderators reserve the right to **remove inappropriate content or members** to maintain a safe and productive environment.

- Avoid sharing **illegal or copyrighted content**.  
- When sharing projects or experiments, provide **clear instructions and context** for others to replicate.  
- Encourage discussion around practical implementation, especially Bitcoin adoption in Africa.

---

## 8. Reporting Issues
- If you encounter inappropriate behavior, harassment, or violations of guidelines, **report to community moderators immediately**.  
- Include details such as usernames, timestamps, and screenshots if available.  
- All reports will be reviewed confidentially and acted upon fairly.

---

## 9. Accountability and Consequences
- Repeated violation of guidelines may result in:
  - Warning messages
  - Temporary removal from channels or community platforms
  - Permanent removal in extreme cases  
- Our goal is to maintain a **supportive learning environment**, not to punish members unnecessarily.
